## Baskets:
Baskets are groups of stocks and etfs that are bought together in a theme.  Not only are they analyzed together, but 
they need to be accounted for together.  There is a hierarchy of investment accounts (see the chart of accounts). 
Each of the baskets need to be balanced at the end of each month.
